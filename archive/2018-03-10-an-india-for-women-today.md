It has been only 70 years since the partition. To put things in perspective, an excerpt from 'India after Gandhi' by Guha goes:

_"Unquestionably the main victims of Partition were women: Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim. As the respected Sindhi Congress politician Choitram Gidwani put it, ‘in no war have the women suffered so much’. Women were killed, maimed, violated and abandoned. After Independence, the brothels of Delhi and Bombay came to be filled with refugee women, who had been thrown out by their families after what someone else had done to them – against their will"_

This country was born from indignities committed against women and their children. How grateful am I to be an educated, encouraged, empowered young woman in the same country in a mere 70 years!

A year ago, I had published an article for my college magazine for women's day. At the time I had written the article, I knew, urgently, of the many freedoms and luxuries I had which some of my closest friends didn't. And for that reason, I felt the need to be vocal about what this privilege means.

_"But like all stories that are filled with hope and substance, yours too will have its fair share of roadblocks and up-hill battles. Not just a few._

_And sometimes- unfortunately-  it will be because of your gender."_

To be honest, it wasn't the most well written, nuanced feminist article out there; even by my own standards. The world was a little different even just a year ago. In a college where a majority of the students were boys, and the few girl students were from privileged backgrounds, there seemed to be no reason for a sense of community that I was seeking out. In fact, I can understand some of my closest feminist guy friends for feeling left out in this grand vision that we all shared. It was, in its own way, hard for me to write an article about feminism addressed to girls without feeling like it was unnecessary and, also, alienating.

A year hence, there has been a lot of debate about a host of issues and situations-- at times, too intense and emotionally involved-- that I have participated in with the acknowledgement that I can be wrong, I can be the perpetrator or, many times, a passive spectator to transgressions I have fought against.

I have aggravated-- and been dismissed beyond a point by-- many friends and colleagues. Yet I thank them all for having participated in a debate that has been a sore topic for every gathering of people across the world.

A year hence, I visited the article again, wondering what I would change about it.

_Maybe you’re one of those privileged few who have not been subject to the injustices of a world that looks through a lens of gender. But whether or not you are, if anyone of us here has had to behave a little differently, a little cautiously, a little subduedly because of fear, or discomfort, or disrespect, would you not empathize? Would you not pause to consider?_

Could I pose this question to men too? Yes. Anybody can empathize with these issues: not just women.

_You know… there’s nothing wrong in calling ourselves a community!_

Would I not seek out a sense of community among women? I still would. We're still in a time when each of us is a role model for many women out there: in politics, technology, businesses, at homes... And, equality is not achieved by being like a man, but being accepted for being a woman. 

It’s simple, really.

If anything at all makes you feel like you’re not secure enough, not valued enough, and not respected enough, you have every right, and even a duty, to speak out.
I end the article urging all women to trust their intuition. To ask themselves:

__Do you feel safe?__ 
__Do you feel comfortable?__
__Do you feel valued?__
__Do you feel respected?__

Your intuition is your first line of defence. There will be many people out there-- men and women -- who will question your gut. Who will silence you when you say that you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, unvalued and disrespected. It is not criminal to be made to feel unsafe, uncomfortable, unvalued and disrespected. Many of us feel that way, and not by virtue of being a woman, but just because it's not something for which a person can be sent to jail doesn't mean that it's not systematically, and tiringly, wrong. It is not unnecessary to ask to be valued for your personhood and not your body, your gender, your sexuality and the expectations attached to how you look and who you are.

Our only weapon, no matter in what way any one of us is marginalized, is our voice. Dignify your cause with the written word, with a spoken thought, with a heartfelt melody, and an extra push and shove towards the finish line. And then... hear the silence of a world that stands awed at the power of your cause, the anthem of your plight, and... finally... finally embraces your reality.
