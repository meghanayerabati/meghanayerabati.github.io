	<p>Welcome! I am Meghana Yerabati. I'm currently studying Mechanical Engineering and Economics. I'm presently in my fourth year of college education at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. I love to read, write and, more recently, code! I'm going to be recording my ventures into a few interests of mine on this website: Economics, Data Science, Statistics, Fiction, Non-fiction, Psychology, Philosophy, Religion, Anthropology, History, etc. I also love reading and writing so you'll be seeing a som fiction, poetry and book reviews.</p>
