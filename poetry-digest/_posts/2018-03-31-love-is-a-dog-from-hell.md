In the fading
twilight
We lay out the
moon
And ate the darkness
of the corner room
where there were no
windows.
A candle flickered for a
place to hide
We ate quiet
comforted in the warmth of
being together

Outside, storms raged
Outside, screams shuddered
The bullet wheezed
A cracked windowpane, our common study,
where our dreams lay gently hidden.
Our books looked on, gingerly
When finally, we saw dawn
Softly, breaking
