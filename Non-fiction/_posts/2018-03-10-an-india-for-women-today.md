It has been only 70 years since the partition. To put things in perspective, an excerpt from 'India after Gandhi' by Guha goes:

_"Unquestionably the main victims of Partition were women: Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim. As the respected Sindhi Congress politician Choitram Gidwani put it, ‘in no war have the women suffered so much’. Women were killed, maimed, violated and abandoned. After Independence, the brothels of Delhi and Bombay came to be filled with refugee women, who had been thrown out by their families after what someone else had done to them – against their will"_

This country was born from indignities committed against women and their children. How grateful am I to be an educated, encouraged, empowered young woman in the same country in a mere 70 years!

A year ago, I had published an article for my college magazine for women's day. At the time I had written the article, I knew, urgently, of the many freedoms and luxuries I had which some of my closest friends didn't. And for that reason, I felt the need to be vocal about what this privilege means.

_"But like all stories that are filled with hope and substance, yours too will have its fair share of roadblocks and up-hill battles. Not just a few._

_And sometimes- unfortunately-  it will be because of your gender."_

The world was a little different even just a year ago; before the #metoo movement snowballed into major power centres. In a college where a majority of the students were boys, and the few girl students were from privileged backgrounds, there seemed to be no reason for a sense of community that I was seeking out. It was, in its own way, hard for me to write an article about feminism addressed to girls without feeling like it was unnecessary and, also, alienating.

A year hence, there has been a lot of debate about a host of issues and situations-- at times, too intense and emotionally involved-- that I have participated in with the acknowledgement that I _can_ be wrong, I _can_ be the perpetrator or, many times, a passive spectator to transgressions I have fought against.

I have aggravated-- and been dismissed beyond a point by-- many friends and colleagues. Yet I thank them all for having participated in a debate that has been a sore topic for every gathering of people across the world. Against this background, I visited the article again, wondering what I would change about it.

_Maybe you’re one of those privileged few who have not been subject to the injustices of a world that looks through a lens of gender. But whether or not you are, if anyone of us here has had to behave a little differently, a little cautiously, a little subduedly because of fear, or discomfort, or disrespect, would you not empathize? Would you not pause to consider?_

Could I pose this question to men too? Yes. Anybody can empathize with these issues: not just women. It remains though that this issue can perhaps never mean the same things to men and women. Yes, there can be another essay called "what has gone wrong for our men" but no issue has ever been solved by prioritizing one over the other. And so, it is the women who feel the need to push to be heard on women's issues. It is women who will feel the emotional baggage from centuries of oppression firing their anger. Don't tell a woman she's overreacting, that it's just how life is. She sees the language of violence everyday in movies, pop songs and casual insults, she knows the catcalls, the unwanted leers, the _bad touch_ when she goes to school, she knows how _potent_ her body can be...even though she's never asked for it. 

She goes through life guarding her sexuality, saving it for a suitor at the blessings of her family, her actions solemnified for being a virtuous woman of the family. Movies are made glorifying her beauty, conflict is based on a violent attack on her dignity, her identity is reduced to the tampered state of her purity. The culture packages women as gorgeous, sexually-charged, powerless beings whom any wandering man would want to lust on and then wonders why women are made uncomfortable at the reactions her body elicits from her boss, her landlord, her peers, the men on the street ...even though she never asked for it!

What is the solution for this rape culture, for this casual sexualization of women with the _unintelligent_ excuse of biology, you ask? 

As women, we can never take the power away from our bodies because we have never had the chance to define how our bodies have been viewed for centuries. Talk to your daughters about their sexuality and about their choice. What we need is a sex-positive culture that realizes that men want to have sex, women want to have sex. Sex is a healthy process of engaging consensually with another _person_ with his/her own history, a pet labrador, a collection of Mohammad Rafi's music, and a weakness for rosgullas. Sex is not had with a thigh, a breast, a mouth and a vagina. Porn can be a great medium for adult entertainment for men and women where they can each enact their fantasies. But in a culture where women are sexualized on screen, sometimes in a violent fashion, men monopolize how sex is portrayed and children are exposed to sex for the first time through porn, and for years together, with no real idea about healthy sex... can you really be surprised that men are uncomfortable that a bra strap is showing, that a slice of stomach is exposed briefly or that a woman's blouse is a little tight... when she is merely going about her day to school, work, or home?

_You know… there’s nothing wrong in calling ourselves a community!_

Would I not seek out a sense of community among women? I still would. We're still in a time when each of us is a role model for many women out there: in politics, technology, businesses, and homes... And, equality is not achieved by being like a man, but being accepted for being a woman. A woman who has applied makeup is _not_ trying to distract anybody at work. A woman need not be _proud_ of the fact that she gets along with men because she's less "girly". A woman is not a _ranty feminist_ for willing to hear, discuss and convey what she knows about a cause that she feels for strongly. A woman can be a _family woman_ or a _career woman_, _stubborn_ or _demure_, _make-up savvy_ or _tech savvy_. But, most importantly, she will inhabit her own skin unapologetically. 

_It’s simple, really._

_If anything at all makes you feel like you’re not secure enough, not valued enough, and not respected enough, you have every right, and even a duty, to speak out._

I end the article urging all women to trust their intuition. It has been a year, but I still believe that it is a good place to start. I ask all women to ask themselves when they're in doubt:

__Do you feel safe?__ 
__Do you feel comfortable?__
__Do you feel valued?__
__Do you feel respected?__

I tell them that their intuition is their first line of defence, that there will be many people out there-- men and women -- who will question their gut, who will silence them everytime they say that they feel unsafe, uncomfortable, unvalued and disrespected. Do you feel comfortable when someone at your workplace persists on giving you a ride? Do you feel safe when your personal pictures are being shared without your consent? Do you feel valued at the workplace when the men judge your character based on the colour of your lipstick? Do you feel respected when you are passed over for a promotion despite your work because you don't indulge in drinking after work because you have a curfew?

It is not criminal to be made to feel unsafe, uncomfortable, unvalued and disrespected, because "no harm, no foul". Many of us feel unvalued and disrespected at times and not by virtue of being a woman. But just because it's not a crime to be treated unfairly due to the nature of your birth doesn't mean that the world isn't __systematically, and tiringly, wrong__. It is not __unnecessary__ to ask to be valued for your personhood... and not your body, your gender, your sexuality and the expectations attached to how you look and who you are. Intuition is not enough to pass a judgement, but it is enough to start a conversation. Do not fail to use it. 

Feminists, meninists, agnosticists have all got things wrong at some point or the other and cried foul at things that don't always seem justified. But don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Take the power away from the naysayers, your body, your sexuality, your identity. There has been no better time to be yourself, or a more opportune time to be wrong no matter what side of the debate you're on. 

Our only defence, no matter in what way any one of us is marginalized, is our voice. Dignify your cause with the written word, with a spoken thought, with a heartfelt melody, and an extra push and shove towards the finish line. And then hear the silence of a world that stands awed at the power of your cause, the anthem of your plight, and, finally... finally embraces your reality.
