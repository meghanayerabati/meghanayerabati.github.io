You are a novice to a field only once.

–
Yours truly

I suspect that the above words might sound naive, and over-reaching too. What, on god’s sweet beautiful earth, can ensure that I shall ever get past being a novice? Nothing at all. But perhaps the nature of the subject that you choose is what makes a difference. So one must enjoy that journey of exploring a new subject that you love…until you’re intellectually gratified. But, of course, learning is infinite, so I do hope this epiphany lasts for a long, long time, and I shall never ever be satisfied.

It all started with a talk by Mr. Mark Lindley on ‘Ecological economics and Amartya’. I had walked into the talk a jolly bit too late but, ah, I made it, and that made all the difference! I walked into that room because Mr. Mark Lindley had a thoroughly peculiar profile. It said that he was an ecological economist and a historian of modern India who had studied at Harvard, then Cambridge, and also held a distinction of being a musicologist from Juliard…and that was enough to blow my mind away. I had come in at the very end of his seminar and I listened to him clarify one or two questions, then I decided to ask one myself. I no longer remember what I had asked,  but I remember him answering, “Ah! That’s a good question. If you take two countries with the same per capita income but with one country providing medical insurance, social security, and better welfare incentives, can you still say that they are of the same standing. Have you heard of the Hawthorne’s* curve?”

I had no inkling of an idea and I said so. He replied, “Oh, you’re not a student of economics? Why not?” He added jokingly, looking at the HoD of the Economics Department for an answer. He gave a hearty laugh and said that I should consider it and that the HoD should get me a degree. Those kind words from a man as impressive as him left me blushing in my seat. I heard him with rapt attention as he spoke about the Pascal’s wager. Perhaps it was the fact that he had a kind voice with a slow intonation that left me feeling like I was in on something utterly unusual and interesting. I never got the courage to talk to him after the talk, and never managed to contact him ever again to thank him. He had inspired me in a fashion that brought about an irreversible change in my interests.

I talked to the HoD after that to find out if I could opt for an additional degree in economics. Few had an idea, and the procedure was not completely predictable. All I knew was that I needed good grades, but I had no idea how good. Until the very end, I was worried that I wouldn’t get the opportunity to pursue this interesting subject that helped me understand the world in more ways than I could imagine.  Economics brought out a clarity of thought in me which had always eluded me until then. When I found out that I was allowed to pursue an additional degree, I was ecstatic. Literally jumping in joy. But, now that I think about it, it hardly matches the happiness of getting your hands dirty by digging your nails deep into a subject.

I have finally started studying phenomena such as inflation, market failure, unemployment, poverty… which have drastic effects on people who have hardly any control over their circumstances. The questions that bother me the most are,

Is it fair that those who are affected the most by an economy are the ones with the least say?
Does any economic event at all justify why any individual has to live with a less than minimum wage rate, or almost inaccessible health care?
Can we empower them or should we design a better system of allocating welfare funds?
I’m sure that there are more questions that can be asked. And as a student of engineering too, I have realized that technology is a great equalizer. But access to technology also has limitations, and we can’t let millions go hungry or fall sick or live less than half-decent lives until then.

Through my readings of economics, I could not help but notice the fact that the beginnings of economics coincided with the beginnings of philosophy itself. The more I read, the more I was learning about the organization of knowledge, of thought, of abstraction, of simplification, or extrapolation. I went deeper and deeper in and read about the math behind modeling small amounts of data. The automation involved in getting insights out of large amounts of data…and I stumbled right into the lap of Data Science.

The result was fireworks.

It lead to a confluence of intellectual gratification and self-satisfaction from studying something that can be as self-evaluative as philosophy but also be rooted firmly in mathematics. Something that can be automated so as to be all-encompassing in its study of data or something that can be abstract in its study. It seems like I’m free-stylin’ between words and numbers, and somehow…simplifying.

And the beauty is in simplicity, isn’t it?

*There is no such a thing as the Hawthorne’s curve. I no longer remember what curve he was talking about and I can’t find my notes from then. (It was conducted more than a year ago.)

Note: This message is a thankyou to Mr. Mark Lindley- who managed to ignite that spark in me; All my teachers- who keep inspiring me to keep learning, and who believe in me. And to my family- for putting their blind faith, and their money, on my pursuit of a subject they don’t completely comprehend. When you’re this happy, it’s good to write it down, document the best parts of your journey, and thank all those people without whom you couldn’t have got there.
