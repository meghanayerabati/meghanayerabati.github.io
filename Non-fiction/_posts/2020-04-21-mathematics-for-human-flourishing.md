A popular website for MBA aspirants is called “Poets and quants”. The motivation behind the name of the website was that applicants are typically either from quantitative streams like engineering, sciences and economics, or more qualitative streams like law, arts and medicine. The applicants are thus categorized into binaries perhaps to help them leverage their relative skills to get into a common program. Although I am not an MBA aspirant, it does seem to me that the binaries through which people are perceived are sticky. They are sticky not only in how we perceive others but also how we perceive ourselves.

This article is inspired by a book I just finished called “Mathematics for Human Flourishing” by Francis Su. This article is about my mathematical journey.

I picked up this book up by happenstance. I was searching for an online course on real analysis in the early days of the corona lockdown. I came across Francis Su’s lectures on youtube and was impressed by their quality. I explored his website and deeply appreciated how he described himself in his bio. I also realised that he had published a book recently and I somehow managed to get a hold of it.

I have always been a fan of scientific writing because they can make big ideas accessible but somehow I’ve never read a book on mathematics before this. (I have read a few essays though such as ‘A mathematician’s apology’ by G. H. Hardy and ‘A mathematician’s lament’ by P. Lockhart, both of which I highly recommend) I had high expectations from the book and it not only lived up to it but also exceeded my expectations. It is interspersed with excerpts from an ongoing correspondence with a prison inmate named Chris Jackson on mathematics and philosophy.

“Every being cries out silently to be read differently”
- Simone Weil

The premise of the book is philosophical: What is the role of mathematics in the context of being human? Mathematics, just like many other fields, is a deeply unequal field. In a world with tremendous emphasis on math test scores in education and math skills in the work place, the pursuit of mathematics is closely linked to external goods or material results and the beauty of math is easily forgotten. More often, the study of mathematics is accompanied by many negative emotions such as shame, fear, and prejudice.

I myself have been plagued with negative thoughts for mathematics for many reasons despite the fact that my mother is a mathematics teacher.

My mother graduated with a physics major and taught physics in a local college. She quit this job to teach mathematics in schools. Later in life, she came across a wonderful instrument called an ‘abacus’. She joined a franchisee program on abacus and taught these skills to many children. Anyone who has seen these kids doing mental math would know that these skills are a little bit of magic. I could appreciate what she achieved through her love for mathematics despite not being a conventional mathematician who writes mathematical theorems or who works for a hedge fund.

If there’s one thing to take away about this book it is that this book is for everyone. Whether you’re a math teacher or a parent or a student, you have within you the immense power to directly or indirectly influence how someone perceives mathematics through implicit or explicit judgement on who is capable of doing mathematics.

When I was at a cross roads in my education, I wanted to eke out a path for myself by studying literature. I always thought of myself as more of the “poet” kind of person. Not that I did not enjoy studying mathematics, I was an inquisitive kid after all, but I just never saw myself as a “math” person.

Poincare famously said that “mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things”. To which a poet quipped: “Poetry is the art of giving different names to the same thing”
- Francis Su

Now that I am studying mathematics to use it as an instrument in the field of economics to make my assumptions precise, the baggage that I am not a “math” person has made me feel almost apologetic in my study. It took me a lot of internal strife to realize that the study of mathematics is not only associated with innate skill but also with many beautiful virtues such as mathematical exploration and play, a search for truth, meaning and beauty.

I had already written about how math is beautiful even for a poet in a playful blogpost called ‘Algebra and aesthetics’. I was very much in the beginning of my journey then and the aesthetics that I spoke of were sensory and wondrous. It is indeed wondrous to a poet who writes of nature to see mathematical patterns in nature. But I never knew the deeper aesthetic of insightful beauty and transcendent beauty that is reserved for those with more skill than I can claim. But I know now that I am deeply motivated to get there. I can finally admit with no sense of shame that there is space for me in this journey of mathematical discovery.

Creative power elevates human dignity.
