The book begins with a personal anecdote of the author where he visits his cousin in a mental asylum in Calcutta. His father, youngest of five brothers, is consumed in the memories of his two brothers whom he has lost to mental illness. Here, the author, reveals to us his familial relationship with genetics and its powerful grip over our daily lives .  Interspersed that it is with such stories, we are forced to come to terms with how we're _hardwired _but also how _intelligent _our design is. All in all, this book is an impressive work of non-fiction for the simple fact that it packs a great amount of insight into a fairly easy-to-read, well-written masterpiece. It also manages to convey the idea that a gene has no purpose, its design is convenient as long as it falls within the confines of human definition.  The gene may help us understand ourselves better, but it never implicitly passes judgement. But one can't help but agree: Humans do.
