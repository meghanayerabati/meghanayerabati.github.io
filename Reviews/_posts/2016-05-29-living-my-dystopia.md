This is not a conspiracy theory.



Before I start convincing  you that the state of things today is bad, let me tell you this: every dystopia ever talks about the worst case scenario. It talks about an absolute state of degradation and then it plants the idea that...you know what? We should perhaps be a bit more cautious with where we're going.

The eternal cynicism that we keep hearing is this: We only act when something terribly wrong happens. But being prepared after an unfortunate event takes place sometimes doesn't help. Especially in the case of black swan events- events that can't be predicted but we want to prevent them anyway. There are millions of unsung heroes everyday who check the engine, who clear the pipes, who stub out their cigarettes before dropping them...thus avoiding major disasters. Then there are our representatives who jump in with protocols after a disaster saying that all the necessary actions are being taken. So we see that there are people who are mechanical with their rules and precautions when dealing with uncertain things...and there are those who act out, sometimes emotionally, the instant after a disaster strikes. An instant too late. And that's the eternal dilemma! Our precautions are not enough and our redressal is only temporary.

But there are those very few people who have the keenness and the critical awareness to pick out systemic flaws that lead us to disaster. These flaws are sometimes so structural that we can't correct them without knowing our social or mental handicaps that are extremely deep seated. The roots of this knowledge are firmly planted in philosophy in every form- anthropology, natural science, mathematics, economics. It's about adapting our knowledge to a situation which is much more complex than a simple word problem.

Perhaps the best way to look at it is to imagine a simple world with a simple problem and then see the agents evolve as the problem evolves as well. The Lord of the Flies is one such allegorical novel that talks about such a simple situation- A bunch of young boys who find themselves estranged on an uninhibited safe island with enough fruit, meat and water. Unlike a survival story like Lost, these boys end up playing and enjoying all day. But what about when they're up against more complex situations? The resulting scenario is a slow descent into madness and murkiness. The funny part? It now seems scarily familiar to how the real world is organized. The power struggles, the emotion, the eventualities and the sacrifices...but in a simple world it needn't happen! So what made it complex?

As one of the estranged boys, Ralph, says in the Lord of the Flies, "I'm frightened. Of us. I want to go home. Oh God, I want to go home."

It seems like we're just as likely to act like young boys on a good island. And we all desperately require a reminder of civilization- a place where one is safe and secure with enough food, shelter and opportunity.

So why don't we act right? I don't know. But I have a feeling that in a world where more of us can think critically instead of just assimilating information... we would not be indulging in child-play, fanaticism, passioned rebellions and unnecessary violence. And here in lies my fear. This critical thinking seems to be a thing of the past. We don't do so many thought-experiments, not as many allegories. The media we use- the cinema, television shows, games - are quick to quench our senses with vivid color, bright lights and pretty faces. The idea being conveyed demands more patience... and dies out as we don't have any to give.

Human beings have evolved not just due to our language but our ability to create fiction, to assign meanings. We have the ability to believe that a Corporation can have a personal account because it has just as much of an identity as a living person, and that having as many as 36,000 gods isn't too much of a crowd. We can believe that nationalism is a human emotion that somehow binds us all. But do these ideas make us or break us?

To answer these questions we need more patience, more effort...and more reading...so that we know what ideas form the skeleton of our institutions and our actions. Reading requires patience, a willing suspension of disbelief, and an active imagination. It also gives you the time to formulate an opinion or an idea while the characters and the setting are in the making. But reading has slowly become a dying habit...so we need to stop and wonder: Are we depriving ourselves of a unique kind of knowledge which can't be found elsewhere?
