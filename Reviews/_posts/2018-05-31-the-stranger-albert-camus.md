Perhaps the best reflection of how much I like a book would be the notes I make from my reading of it.

I highlight passages that have been written in a delightful fashion or convey an idea that sparks my interest and imagination. Sometimes I note it in my own hand in my diary when it is worthy of being penned down in ink onto rough sheets of paper. It goes to show how confused Camus left me that I had no highlights at the end of my reading of _The Stranger_. Some books do demand a second reading but the protagonist in the book was wholly disinterested in what was happening to him and I didn't share much of a different view about it. I can't see myself reading this book again because of Camus' writing style which is quite dispassionate.

Meursault, the main character in _The Stranger_, is for a major part of the book indifferent to his own existence and the relationships he shares with people. This is shown in the very first line when he says that “Mother died today. Or maybe, yesterday; I can’t be sure.” Meursault's choices for a great portion of the book are driven only by baser emotions or laid-back indifference making him very unrepresentative of the human condition. 

My first impression was that the entire book led up to the ideas of mortality, religion and individualism that come in the very final part of the book when finally grows inside Meursault a passion, a fury and a great clarity. Yet, it remained wholly detached from the gripping ways in which these concepts engulf our existance as it comes up so suddenly in the very end. I decided to read critical commentaries about the book to understand what I missed knowing wholly well that there would always be a deeper meaning which I might not understand immediately. I realized that Meursault's indifference sets a backdrop against which his final clarity becomes even more profound. His complete abandon of his own fate makes us question the justice that was meted out to him by society.

I shall read the final pages of _The Stranger_ again, if not the whole book, along with some critical commentary to understand Camus' philosophy of _absurdism_ i.e., the illusions we create to make peace with the human condition of being aware of our own mortality.
