Now that I will be doing financial research for the next five months– I seem to be finding lots of time to write. I consider this nothing less than a fully-funded sabbatical where all I do is learn, apply and document. Moving ahead, though, most book reviews that I publish of non-fiction would be having spoilers ,i.e., more information than you’d like, perhaps? The reason is two-fold:

I have a damned memory. I’m serious. My long term memory is worse than a foggy recollection of  a night spent completely drunk. Non-fiction is often wasted on me because I tend to forget names, places, events… Writing for me is a way of committing things to memory. If not the specifics, I at least try to document the outline so that the rest is mere interpolation.

Since writing always has been a personal exercise for me in documenting ideas, emotions and learning- I try to be critical when I write which means that sometimes you will find yourself reading spoilers.

I write for me.

I’ve always loved to write and I want to do more of what I love… even if that means a few spoilers for the readers!
