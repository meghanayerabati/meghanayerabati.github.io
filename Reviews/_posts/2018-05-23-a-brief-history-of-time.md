	It has been little less than three months since the phenomenal Stephen Hawking passed away. There has been so much said about the extent of impact he has had on the imagination of many-- _A Brief History of Time_ became a bestseller and has sold more than 10 million copies in 20 years. The wit and humor of his public persona frame his astounding intellect in an awe-inspiring fashion. Yet his written work does not disappoint in comparison at all as it manages to be clear, crisp and captivating. As is shown in the movie, also one of my favorites, _The Theory of Everything_, much of the book explores his life-long ambition to reconcile concepts of _general theory of relativity_ - the laws that govern matter at the scale of stars and planets- and _quantum mechanics_ - the laws that govern at the scale of the atom to come up with the grand equation that explains the universe across scale. 

	I had tried, and failed, to read _A Brief History of Time_ in school. After having been grilled by the education system to learn a lot of science over the last seven years, I could appreciate the book a lot more. I could also appreciate the science that was not explained in the classroom. Most of all I could appreciate the effort towards the discovery of gravitational waves by the LIGO team since 2002 and the resultant paper which had 1004 authors. The book walks one through many questions-- _Is the earth spherical of flat? Does everything revolve around the earth? Is the universe finite or infinite? Is the universe static or in motion? Has the universe always existed?_ The experience of reading this book was almost philosophical as Hawking himself quipped, "In the eighteenth century, philosophers considered the whole of knowledge, including science, to be their field and discussed questions such as: did the universe have a beginning? However, in the nighteenth and twentieth centuries, science became too technical and mathematical for the philosphers or anyone else except a few specialists. Wittgenstein, the most famous philosopher of this century, said,_The sole remaining tast of philosophy is the analysis of language_" And so, as Hawking describes the universe, he's the philosopher with whom we embark on a journey to _know the mind of God_.

	As I explore my love for science writing and the idea of making big science more accessible, I would certainly recommend this book as one of the best I've read while keeping my mind open to more recent books published in the last 30 years. I choose to refrain from giving him a 5 though: the poet in me is a stickler for beautiful writing and I was left wanting better prose describing the cosmos!
