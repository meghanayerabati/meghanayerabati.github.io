My current project is to brush up my knowledge of derivatives using python. For this, I will be reading two books â€“ Derivatives Analytics with Python by Yves Hilpisch from Wiley Financial Series and the classic Options, Futures and Other Derivatives by John C. Hull.


I will be posting the results from exercises from the book on the blog. The code is available in the book and on [github]("https://github.com/yhilpisch/dawp"). At the end of it, I will also try to work on a project of my own using the concepts learned in the book. This should be fun!


Broadly, the scope of this book is to: 
* characterize a market model
* study a few theoretical market models and the calibrate them to market-determined prices
* understand how to value and hedge exotic products based on market models


Below are a few results from the textbook:
