1Q84 is a year set in a curious world that is misleadingly similar to the real world but one which is home to mysterious forces that defy the rules and realities understood by the characters and the readers alike. The story revolves primarily around two important characters - Aomame and Tengo- who are drawn into the new world 1Q84 by the strange emotional significance of a single shared moment from their childhood that has left a large void in their present lives. Other characters, which are in no way less intricately defined, are the extraordinary seventeen year old Fuka-Eri, the old dowager who owns a home for victims of domestic abuse, her wise bodyguard Tamaru, and Tengo's own father. Some characters appear only in one or two of the books- such as characters of Tengo's older ex-girlfriend Yoshida, Aomame's friend Ayumi and the tenacious private investigator called Uchikawa- and yet come to life with the exuberance of their own personalities and histories.

The first book describes the lives of Aomame and Tengo without any apparent intersection in their lives save the one incident from their childhood that becomes a strong part of their identities. Each character derives its entire persona from such strong incidents in their lives. The stories run in parallel in the second book as they deal with a fringe religious group called Sakigake and try to comprehend the fantastical story of the 'little people'. The recurring references to memories, dreams, feelings of loss, and explorations of faith are crafted into the story with the power of Murakami's beguiling writing making this book an interesting look into the human psyche. The narrative is simple but has imagery which is at once both familiar as well as surreal- such as the appearance of the two moons in 1Q84, or animals which are agents of unknown forces in the world- making the writing eerie and pervasive in effect. Murakami surely paints a picture of a world shrouded in darkness and death where one is waiting with the hairs of one's neck standing. Some of the dialogues of characters are almost prophetic- as they theorize about free will or borrow from Jung, they are unknowing participants of the story but also seem to be aware of a greater truth. While 1Q84 is meant to be the dystopian brother of 1984, the ambiguity in the physics of this world makes it pointedly different. Many questions remain unanswered and a lot of assumptions are demanded of the reader without any justification from the author. Although ambiguity can be thought provoking, after a point I couldn't help but question whether the author was being excessively profound or exceedingly lazy.

Despite the enchanting writing, the strong characters, the surrealistic undertones that bring about multiple interesting questions... I could not help but feel that the freedom offered by a world of indeterminate rules and suspenseful characters has been subjected to some amount of artistic abuse. Towards the end of the second book and for a good chunk of the third book, I found myself having too many questions and too few answers. This, as you can understand, can be quite frustrating. That said, I still do think that the entire project itself is extraordinary because it is ambitious and, somewhat, original in its undertaking. Exploiting concepts such as parallel/alternative universes, the physical manifestation of emotion and conscience, a re-evaluation of morality in the context of a changed 21st century world of expressways and Heckler and Koch revolvers, Murakami makes this book modern yet alluringly mystical. There must be quite a few subtle allusions and themes at play here that I've missed but that's okay. I'm gonna pick the book up and delve into its world of secrets again because this book offers a good challenge to the grey cells in critically analysing modern literature.
