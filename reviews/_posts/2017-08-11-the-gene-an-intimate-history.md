It was at least six years ago that I was reading a book named ‘Something called Nothing’ by R. Podolny– a fascinating science book about the properties of physical vacuum. It captured my imagination both as a concept and as a work of literature. Of science writing, Podolny – a Soviet Science writer educated as a historian writes-

“science writing is intended, in essence, primarily for young people. Hence, it can and should deal with the fields of science “where the action is”; informing the reader not only about what has already been achieved, but also about what still remains to be done.“

Science- a subject I usually found too glib and dry for my taste-  became this adventure full of uncertainty and promise. A scientist who can write is a blessing to have; a true aesthete. Now, years later, the same feeling has been evoked in me by The Gene- an intimate history. Historically illuminating, thematically coherent, and supremely insightful — Siddhartha Mukherjee’s The Gene is a phenomenal book of scientific writing that I would recommend to anybody who would want to know about the history, development and consequences of ideas embodied by genetics.

Siddhartha Mukherjee- an Indian- American physician and oncologist- is the only Indian to have received a Pulitzer for General Non-fiction and deservingly so!

Mukherjee traces the history of genetics from the accidental discovery of patterns of inheritence by Mendel to Watson and Crick’s  three-dimensional model of the double-helix– writing of attempts at decoding the nature of the basic unit of information in its historical, social and economic context.

The latter is extremely important because science writing has the potential to be truly inspiring when we study it in context. We might not all construe science as a sequence of equations and numbers floating in space, but we can intuitively understand the train of thought that lead to scientists asking the very questions they asked, we can appreciate the magnitude of these discoveries. DeVries, Morgan, Fisher, Dobzhansky, Griffith, Avery, Monod… As we learn of their contributions, we learn, truly, how scientists build on the shoulders of those who came before them even while recognizing that they’re human.  We learn of their flaws and failures. We also understand the scary implications of an incomplete knowledge of science- such as the justification of ethical transgressions like eugenics in Nazi propoganda-  making it all the more riveting and urgent!

Mukherjee then crosses into the near-fantastical space of genetic engineering and its moral repercussions – the reading of genes through gene cloning and sequencing, the consolidation of the human source code through the monumental Human Genome Project, the iconic Asilomar Conference that introduced the concept of scientific restraint in the highly potent field of genetic engineering. He builds, slowly and patiently, from simple questions towards the varying complexities of ethics, identity and disease… and mankind’s insatiable desire for perfection.

He writes of the leaps in medicine made by the field of gene therapy and the real possibility of writing a human gene in the next two decades without any unnecessary hullabaloo– a hallmark of the way scientists think, unlike technologists.

I wouldn’t shy from giving my two cents about the writing style because, god knows, it deserves acclaim. The book begins with a personal anecdote of the author where he visits his cousin in a mental asylum in Calcutta. His father, youngest of five brothers, is consumed in the memories of his two brothers whom he has lost to mental illness. Here, the author, reveals to us his familial relationship with genetics and its powerful grip over our daily lives .  Interspersed that it is with such stories, we are forced to come to terms with how we’re hardwired but also how intelligent our design is.

All in all, this book is an impressive work of non-fiction for the simple fact that it packs a great amount of insight into a fairly easy-to-read, well-written masterpiece. It also manages to convey the idea that a gene has no purpose, its design is convenient as long as it falls within the confines of human definition.  The gene may help us understand ourselves better, but it never implicitly passes judgement.

But one can’t help but agree: Humans do.
