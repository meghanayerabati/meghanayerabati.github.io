"Escape" by Manjula Padmanabhan was promising!

I wondered if it would be a story rivaling 'The Hand-maid's Tale', 'Rosemary's baby' or 'The Stepford wives' which uses horror as a medium for social commentary on the role of women in Indian society. Well, it was a great premise, I must admit. The characters, too, were powerful. But it falters quite a bit in execution as it suffers from bad pacing and a flat climax. It reclaims itself a little bit towards the very end but not enough. (3 out of 5)

Escape by Manjula Padmanabhan has the makings of a very good story. In a futuristic India, women (or "vermin") are completely eradicated when another means of child-rearing is discovered. Three men, Eldest, Middlest and Youngest, secretly foster a young girl as her "uncles". But as she is growing older, it becomes increasingly difficult to hide her from the prevailing dictatorship. So Youngest and the girl embark on a journey to escape the country.

The story tries to deal with some adult themes such as the incestuous desires towards the sole "woman", the kind of toxic behaviours that come to the foreground in a world lacking women, the sexual exploration of a young girl who is not aware of how potent her mere existence is. Kudos for the premise, if only it had better execution!
