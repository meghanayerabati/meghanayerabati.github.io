In the last couple of months that I have retreated indoors due to the growing pandemic fears in my city, I have experienced and written about friendship, community, pleasures of daily life, recountings about old days, and some other themes. I realize, however, that I haven’t written yet about the pandemic. Despite being an active writer, for the most part at least, I have never felt more aware that I am bearing witness to a profound moment in history. How does one begin to write about such an important moment? The thought of it overwhelmed me. 

A similar question must have occurred to Fang Fang - a 65-year-old writer in Wuhan, China - who started documenting everyday life during a lockdown imposed in the city of Wuhan starting on January 25th, 2020 and ending over 2 months later on April 8th 2020. As I begin to write this piece, it is the 13th of August, 2020. I have been at home in India for more than 5 months, twice as long as Fang Fang was in lockdown when she ended her diary. Russia has recently announced that they have found a vaccine for the virus. The human toll so far has been too high and we can only hope that things are getting better for good. The total COVID-related deaths in India are more than 10 times as many as China, and a lot more spread out in geography than observed in China. Although the official numbers by the Chinese Communist Party are not easily trusted by the international community, Fang Fang’s diary’s estimate seems to be close as well. Like me, many world leaders must have found narrative evidence of how China handled the crisis in Fang fang’s diary. This was important also because China was one of the first countries to deal with such a crisis.

But Fang Fang’s diary was famous in China for different reasons. It seemed to help people understand the crisis a little more as their lived realities changed drastically almost overnight. As someone who is neither a medical professional, a public official, nor an essential services worker, Fang Fang wondered what she could do to help during the crisis. An ocean away, Michael Berry wondered the same in the United States. A month after Fang Fang had started writing about the events unfolding in Wuhan, Michael Berry decided to translate her pieces in real-time. And so, even though the pandemic hasn’t ended just yet, a first-person account of the COVID pandemic is already out. Curiously, unlike other pieces of literature where we try to find common themes in history that we can interpret in a different context, we find that the writing foretells the future almost exactly. 

The writing - as it moves from Fang Fang’s screen to Michael Berry’s screen to mine - runs on three different timelines. Michael Berry talks about the temporal split that we experience reading Fang Fang’s book. In one moment we are immersed in the writer’s world, a moment later we are in our own world as lead characters in the same story. But as a translator, there was a one month lag for Berry. The door to the future was open but only an inch. As I read the book now, with diary entries from 3 crucial months during which cases rose and fell, I have the power to wade through reality at my pace, unlike the writer and the translator who experienced reality at time’s pace. What this means is that there were days when I was gripped by anxiety and I would read this book to understand the current state of the world more intimately. And although I was comforted by its familiarity, I would also sometimes be disturbed by the description of rising cases in Wuhan. You see, I could just read faster, skim through a few paragraphs, or take a time out from my reading until I felt like the world inside the book was in more in tandem with my inner feelings. But the minute I would stop reading the book, I would have to face a reality where I am the lead character of the same story but I cannot fast forward time, I am forced to live this difficult period one day at a time where cases are rising but the peak has not yet arrived. And on some days, this is not easy. Truth is, I am worried for my country. The virus may not have entered our homes, touch wood, but it seems to already have one foot in the door. 

Many in my family, friends and colleagues would know that I have old grandparents at home who are nearly bed-ridden. They need an Ayah to help them with their everyday tasks round the clock. Most of these Ayahs are young women from villages who are not very educated. The coronavirus has led to a large spread reverse migration to rural areas due to which there is a shortage of Ayahs. So when my grandparents’ caretakers up and left, we had a problem. How do we find a replacement on an urgent basis while also ensuring that the replacement would not be corona positive? We fervently contacted many agencies while also trying to steer clear of frauds as this sector is quite informal and disorganized. We finally managed to find an agency nearby whose office we had inspected and found reasonably legitimate. They sent us a young couple who they assured were not sick from the virus. The couple agreed to stay at home and take care of my grandparents. 

It has been a few days since they arrived. They seem somewhat settled. I make small talk once in a while when I spent time with my grandparents. They have a young child back in their village who is living with his grandparents. Today, they asked me whether young children are at risk with this virus. I said it doesn’t seem to be as fatal for children but it is still advisable to stay safe as we don’t know the long term effects of the virus on young children. They tell me that their relative back in their village recently passed away, most likely from COVID although he was never tested. They sent the body home for the last rites. Most of his close family who visited the funeral are now suffering from fevers. The area has now been turned into a containment zone. The mother tells me that her mother-in-law visited the funeral too. She is worried about her child. 

The virus is spreading speedily in rural areas which do not have many hospitals nearby that are equipped to treat these cases at low cost. People from rural areas have to travel quite some distance to go to hospitals by which time they are already in critical condition. Although the Telangana government has been commendably releasing a lot of information about vacant beds in many hospitals, these hospitals are still far from most rural areas. We need more hospitals. We need more medical camps. We need to make sure that the last-mile delivery of medical health care is addressed immediately. Months after reading Fang Fang’s diary, I face the same question: I am not a medical worker, not a public servant, not an essential services worker, what can I do? And so, I decided to write about the coronavirus after 5 months of choosing not to write about it. I don’t have much to offer except for what I hope would be life-affirming, soul-affirming words in a time when our lives feel like they are on the edge and our souls are perpetually in a state of unrest. Only time will tell whether we are at the fag end of our corona stories or bang in the middle.
