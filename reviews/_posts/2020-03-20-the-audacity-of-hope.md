This book is lofty and not in a bad way. Obama's characteristic optimism is front and centre in this book as he shares his thoughts on politics, race, education, employment, health care & foreign policy based on his experiences as a Senator. 

Obama attempts to find a middle ground in contentious issues while running the risk of appearing to be fence-sitting or long-winded. Although he doesn't do it with clinical forthrightness, it can't be denied that his writing cuts the ice in addressing political stalemates. 

I found the initial chapters on political rancour, on the importance of values in drafting policy, on enabling economic security, entrepreneurial innovation and upward mobility as guiding principles... refreshing. 

Obama weaves his own story and observations into his comments on public policy. His writing is readable but his politics is not always concise. A reading of the issues in the book may be one-sided but it gives a good idea on the motivation. 

Mostly, I found the reading fulfilling because I could rationalize some of the issues closer to home such as the partisan nature of current Indian politics. The importance of values in politics from which the popularity of Hindutva stems. 

In terms of economics, India is very much behind the US because we have no concept of social security or universal health care. We also have a more unequal society with challenges to upward mobility. 

Reading this book gave me a language to address Indian issues without drowning in the toxic cesspool that is political commentary today. And, for that, this was a worthy read once you get past the occasional loftiness and long-windedness of the book.
