My second project is to strengthen my understanding of Asset Liability Management framework of banks to manage interest rate and liquidity risks. This is motivated, of course, by my role as an analyst in the Chief Investments Office & Treasury in J.P. Morgan & Chase.

This particular book helped me brush up my theoretical understanding of ALM framework. The challenge is to translate this theoretical understanding into a quantitative model using python/R.

Broadly, the scope of this book is to: 
* study the history and evolution of ALM in banks and insurance companies
* study the regulatory context within which banks and insurance companies presently operate their ALM frameworks.i.e., Basel I- III and Solvency laws 
* study the theoretical underpinnings of deterministic and stochastic ALM models


Below are a few results from the textbook:

Finally, the aim of the ALM department is to ensure that the risk-reward profile of the bank is optimal given its long-term outlook of the macro-environment. Additionally, a quick note that Basel IV (2016-17) is not included in the book as it was not released at the time of publishing. Basel IV require a significant increase in capital and is more conservative than Basel III as it includes:
* A standardised floor, so that the capital requirement will always be at least 72.5% of the requirement under the Standardized approach
* A simultaneous reduction in Standardised risk weights for low risk mortgage loans
* Requiring banks to meet higher maximum leverage ratios (an initial leverage ratio maximum is likely to be set as part of the completion of the Basel III package)
* A higher leverage ratio for Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), with the increase equal to 50% of the risk adjusted capital ratio
* More detailed disclosure of reserves and other financial statistics
