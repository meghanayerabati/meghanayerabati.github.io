## A boutique-career path

Research in finance, economics and other social sciences may seem like a boutique-career path simply because there are many ways to go about exploring this domain. There are multiple avenues to be explored in academia, think tanks and private institutions. Even a typical work day of a researcher is a piece-meal project involving varied tasks such as field responsibilities, quantitative analysis, paper-writing, teaching, managing research finances, visiting and conducting conferences. This landscape can be difficult to explore in India precisely because it is such a long and nuanced career path. I have been quite proactive in exploring these career paths so I decided that there may be some merit in sharing some of this research if it would be helpful for others with similar interests.
