	<h1>Meghana Yerabati's Website</h1>
	<p>Welcome!</p>
	<p> I'm a final year student of Mechanical Engineering and Economics at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. I love to read, write and, more recently, code! I'm going to be recording my ventures into a few interests of mine on this website: Economics, Finance, Data Science, Mathematics, Literature, etc. <em>(Notice how mechanical engineering is conspicuously absent?)</em> You can find my attempts at prose and poetry here too!</p>
	<p>This is a basic website powered by Jekyll and Markdown. I think it's quite neat, what do you think?</p>
