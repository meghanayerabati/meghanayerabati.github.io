	<p> Hello! I'm a final year student of Mechanical Engineering and Economics at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. I love to read, write and, more recently, code! I'm going to be recording my ventures into a few interests of mine on this website: Economics, Finance, Data Science, Mathematics, Literature, etc.
	<p>This is a basic website powered by Jekyll and Markdown. I think it's quite neat, what do you think? Just head over to the menu called blog and make sure you explore the sub-blogs leisurely...</p>
