	<p> Hello! I'm currently working in JP Morgan Chase as an Interest Rate Risk Analyst. I love to read, write and, more recently, code!  I'm going to be recording my ventures into a few interests of mine on this website: Quantitative Economics, Data Science, Macro/Finance, and Literature.
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://meghanayerabati.github.io/Projects/">Projects</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://meghanayerabati.github.io/Non-fiction/">Editorial and Opinion </a></li>	
	<li><a href="https://meghanayerabati.github.io/Reviews/">Book Reviews</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://meghanayerabati.github.io/Poetry-Digest/l">Poetry Reviews </a></li>
</ul>
	<p> I also write a bit of fiction and poetry. If you want to check it out, you can find it 
	<a href="https://pulsatinglife.wordpress.com/">here</a>.</p>

	<p>This is a basic website powered by Jekyll and Markdown. I think it's quite neat, what do you think? Just head over to the menu and make sure you explore the sub-blogs leisurely...</p>
