	<h1>Meghana Yerabati's website</h1>
	<p>Welcome! I am Meghana Yerabati. I'm currently studying Mechanical Engineering and Economics. I'm presently in my final year of college education at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. I love to read, write and, more recently, code! I'm going to be recording my ventures into a few interests of mine on this website: Economics, Data Science, Statistics, Fiction, Non-fiction, Psychology, Philosophy, Religion, Anthropology, History, etc. Something exciting is coming here... so stay put!</p>
